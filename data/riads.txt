An exclusive immersion into the art of Moroccan living
A symbol of Moroccan culture and craftsmanship, a Riad is a
traditional house built around a garden (the meaning of the
word in Arabic) or a patio, complete with a refreshing fountain
at its centre. It is a place of absolute tranquillity, removed from
the pressures of time, and the hustle and bustle of city life.
At La Mamounia, we wanted to offer our guests this experience
so they could enjoy an exceptional stay that combines
accommodation in the finest Marrakech architectural tradition
with the personalised services of our palace Hotel.
Three Riads have been built in our Gardens, each with its own
private entrance for absolute tranquillity and seclusion.
Savour the very essence of discreet luxury
Elegant and harmonious, the décor of the La Mamounia’s Riads
is on a par with that of our most opulent suites, mirroring the
vision of luxury that is synonymous with our historic hotel: a
subtle combination of exquisite materials, traditional Moroccan
craftsmanship and refined contemporary touches.
