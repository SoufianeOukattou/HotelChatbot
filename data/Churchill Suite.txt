It is a marvellous place, one of the best
hotels I have ever visitedâ€œ Winston Churchill
loved La Mamounia, where he would come
to indulge his passion for painting.
The Grande Dame of Marrakech pays tribute to
him with a bar in his name and with this outstanding
suite, whose tartan armchairs and various living
spaces make it as inviting as it is intimate.
