Gourmet pleasures to be enjoyed together
Whether you are staying at the hotel or not, brunch
at La Mamounia is a true celebration of the art of
Sunday living, an unmissable event in Marrakech’s
Hivernage quarter.
It is an invitation to enjoy the moment, to let time
gently slip by in this marvellous poolside setting in
the heart of the hotel’s luxuriant Gardens.
A moment to share with friends, family or en têteà-tête - with buffets to delight both young and old!
Utterly resplendent, our buffets awaken the senses
with their colours and aromas.
Colourful fruit, crisp breads and golden pastries sit
alongside irresistible cakes and desserts by Pierre
Hermé, not to mention an array of delicious dairy
products...
A real counter of delights!

Opening times
The Sunday brunch is offered to you
from 12 :30am to 03 :30pm
