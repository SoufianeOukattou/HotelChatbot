The name of this Exceptional Suite is a
reminder that the history of La Mamounia
dates back to the 18th century, when
Prince Al Mamoun received a sumptuous
thirteen-hectare orchard from his father
as a wedding gift.
It is to the splendour of that era that the
d√©cor pays homage, an expression of
supreme luxury with its carved wooden
ceilings, chiselled plaster friezes and
zellige mosaics.
