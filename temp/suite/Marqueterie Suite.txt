Wood reigns supreme in this Exceptional
Marquetry Suite with its hushed
atmosphere that adds a wonderfully warm
feel to the two bedrooms and lounge.
While elegant paintings on wood depict
traditional scenes of Moroccan life, the
sleek 1920s furniture complements the
strict, clean lines that characterise this
luxury suite.
Outside, the terrace offers privileged views
over the Gardens, while the Atlas Mountains
can be discerned in the distance.
Each room has its own bathroom with
separate shower and bathtub.
