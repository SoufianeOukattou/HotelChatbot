The restaurant, its terrace and buffets
From breakfast onwards, in this superb venue built
as a tribute to the Menara pavilion in Marrakech, the
restaurant, its terrace and buffets offer a cornucopia of
mouth-watering temptations.
Starting the day here is nothing short of idyllic. In the earlymorning calm, soothed by birdsong and the murmur of
the great fountain, time takes on its own tempo.
At the heart of La Mamounia, the magnificent swimming
pool shimmers and sparkles in the morning sunshine
while the palm trees in the garden sway gently in the
cool breeze.
Later, the buffet lunch gets under way, and the place
comes alive with the aroma of grilled meats seared before
your very eyes, and whetting the appetite, while golden
poultry, roasted to perfection, makes its appearance.
The art of serving and carving is celebrated here, and
the meal a true feast to behold.
