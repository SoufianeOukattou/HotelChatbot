While the Koutoubia Deluxe Rooms offer a
privileged view of the celebrated 12th-century
mosque, the Park Deluxe Rooms promise a unique
vista over La Mamounia’s enchanting Gardens.
Slightly more spacious and located on the hotel’s
upper floors, the Agdal Deluxe Rooms overlook the
pool, Gardens and the historic Agdal quarter. In the
distance, the Atlas Mountains only serve to further
enhance this unique backdrop.
